# Encode Transcribe
Hello,

This code essentually encodes text in various forms (mostly images), and allows you to then decode the text. To use the code, you may either download the direct python files in the folder called "Encode Transcribe Raw Code" or use the executable in the folder "Encode Transcribe App Version A". Reguardless, of the method chosen, when the code is run, it should show something like this:

Note that there are several menu options. To begin, we have to put in text to decode. This is done by either writing the text in the "Text to Encode" textbox on the top of the screen, or uploading a pdf. Then, you will have choose the limited encoding method in the drop down "Artistic Encoding Method" menu. Then, please continue to add the details to the other options in the "Output Setting" menu. This includes the size of the overall image, the size of the border, whether the output is randomized (this particlar option works on everythin but QR codes), the name of the folder in which the image and key is saved, and the name of the resulting text/image file. 

After you have inputted all options, please make the image by clicking "Create Artistic Encoding" button. Then you will see a preview of the drawing/text. The actual files themselves are in the folder in the location you have stated in the option. Some examples of what these may look like can be seen below:

Now, to deocde the image/text, please click the decoder button, which is a button on the top right of the screen. This will give something like the image below:

To actually decode, please input the location of the image and the key in the "Select File" section. Then, please click the decode artwork to get the decoded text. Note that depending on the quality of the image, which is based on the size of the image, and whether the correct shapes and geometries are fitted correctly, the encoding may have errors, so please use at your own risk.
